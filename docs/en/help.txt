What is advanced notepad?
It is a text editor designed for screen reader users.
This editor makes it easier to control text files with the many features it provides.
Like the tab system, autosave the edited text in the tab and some ready-made HTML code. and more.
#Program features.
*Provides tabs, which save text as soon as a file is opened, away from the original file.
And if you like to save the text at any time you want, you can save it.
This means that if you exit the program it will still keep the tab with the edited text.
Once you open a file, a new tab will be created for that file. You can also create tabs very easily and move between them quickly and smoothly.
*Save text automatically:
That is, as soon as you type anything that is saved in the tab, not in the file, and to apply these changes, it is sufficient to make a save, in the case of a tab without a file, it will prompt you to choose the file path and so on, but if the tab belongs to a file, it will be saved directly.
You can also restore the original text of the file if you want to, but before it is saved in the file.
You can also change or disable the autosave method. There are two autosave methods that you can select one of them. The first is when you type any character, the autosave is done, and the second is when you press the spacebar, it will be saved automatically. Or you can disable it, that is, you must manually save, and this means that the program does not save the text in the file tab.
*Text translation:
The translation feature is available in two types, the first is the translation of the entire file
And you are free to how to get the result between 3 options available to you, which is to replace the current text with the translated text, create a new tab and place the text in it, or copy the result to the clipboard.
The second type, is the translation of a selected text, and also you can get the result by speak only, or copy to clipboard, or both speak and copy to clipboard.
You can translate texts of unlimited length.

The rest are the basic things that every text editor has, namely search, replace, and so on.
